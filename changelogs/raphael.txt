This is Android 15 QPR1 with January 2025 security patches

Notes:
==============================
- LineageOS-based source. Signed build.
- Always dirty flash at your own risk. If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots.
- Kernel is already pre-rooted with KSU. Just install the KSU app.
- Play Integrity passes, RCS works (As of 01/16/2025).
